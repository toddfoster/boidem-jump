** What
Facilitate rapid navigation through a potentially complex org document. Begin by offering one-key access to all top-level headings. If the selected heading has sub-headings, recurse into it and start again.

** How?
Sorry no convenient MELPA package. Yet another thing to learn. For now, arrange for this code to be executed and optionally bind it to a convenient key.

** Why
Scratching several itches at once:
- to navigate more conveniently through complex org documents
- to learn more emacs
- to start learning elisp
- sinister laughter as I write code that writes code

** Welcome
I welcome comments and pull-requests.
